# Favour Auction

This is a web app designed to faciliate a favour auction. The premise of a favour auction is that participants submit various "favours" that they would be happy to do for someone else eg. 3 hours of linear algebra tutoring, write and record a song on acoustic guitar for you, message you every day for a month etc

Everyone starts with 100 favour points. Items are auctioned of in the following formats:

- English auction
- Dutch auction
- First price sealed
- Vikrey (winner pays second highest bid)
- Chinese
- Penny, (parameters chosen by admin, all profits go to person whose item is being sold)
